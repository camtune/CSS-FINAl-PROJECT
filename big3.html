               <h2>HTML5</h2>
               <section>
                <p>
                Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language used to create documents 
                that will be displayed on a web browser. HTML instructs the browser on how to display data on the page. 
                These instructions often cover the layout of the page, fonts, colors, headings, title, tables, 
                and graphics. HTML5 Boilerplate is the most popular HTML framework in use today.
                </p>

                <h3>Why HTML Is Necessary</h3>

               <p>The importance of HTML can not be overstated—it’s impossible to work in front end web development without 
                using this essential language. HTML is the standard language used in the creation of websites and is supported 
                by all modern Internet browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Samsung Internet, and Opera. HTML is 
                so prevalent that it’s been used on at least 93% of all websites in the world. As the fundamental 
                building block for all web pages, HTML should be the first language any potential Web Developer learns.</p>

               <h2>CSS3</h2>
               <section>
                <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language that’s used to style the text, color, buttons, and tables 
                of a website plus structure how its pages are laid out. CSS allows for content and formatting to remain separate 
                so webpages can adapt to different types of devices of various sizes. Some of the most frequently used CSS frameworks are Twitter Bootstrap, 
                Tailwind CSS, Bulma, Foundation, Skeleton, UI Kit, Pure, Semantic UI, and Materialize.
                </p>
                <h3>Why CSS Is Necessary</h3>

                <p>CSS is necessary because, without it, webpages look awful. CSS easily adds style to boring webpages with just a few lines of code. 
                    And instead of coding each page of a website one by one, those few lines of code make it possible for styles to be applied consistently 
                    across an entire website, saving Web Developers an extraordinary amount of time. <br><br>

                    If a website were to use HTML alone without incorporating CSS, it would just be text on a plain white background, 
                    which isn’t very interesting to look at. HTML and CSS must be paired together to create visually appealing websites. 
                    HTML is used to specify what content should be on the page while CSS provides all the style, including font type, 
                    color, layout, and more. When building websites, it’s practically impossible to create an inviting, interesting website without CSS.</p>

                JavaScript is a language used to program the behavior of web pages, making them more dynamic and interactive to engage the user. 
                For example, JavaScript can be used to play audio or video, display animations, progress through a slideshow of various pictures, 
                and alter a button’s colors when a mouse hovers over it. Vue.js, Angular, and Svelte are the most common JavaScript frameworks used in 
                front end web development. he most popular JavaScript library in use today is React, which was created by Facebook.


                </p>
                <h3>Why JavaScript Is Necessary</h3>

                <p>The primary reason why JavaScript is necessary for front end web development is that it adds interactivity to webpages; 
                    HTML determines the content and CSS styles it while JavaScript brings it all to life. It’s difficult to create dynamic, 
                    user-friendly websites without JavaScript, which is why it’s so prevalent—JavaScript can be found on the front end of more 
                    than 97% of all websites in existence. It’s so ubiquitous that support for JavaScript is built into every modern web browser,
                    including Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. <br><br>
                
                    JavaScript is also an essential language to learn because it’s so versatile; it can be used in a variety of ways, including on 
                    websites, web applications, games, and mobile apps plus it offers a wide range of frameworks, libraries, and tools to speed up 
                    programming. JavaScript also works well with other languages and can be inserted into any webpage regardless of the file extension.
                    And thanks to the runtime environment Node.js,  which allows JavaScript to run on the server side, it’s even possible to 
                    build an application from back to front using JavaScript.
